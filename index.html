    <p class="about">
        Bridge Finance offers you Payday loans that are short-term loans taken to tie up urgent financial needs that cannot wait until payday. These are usually small amounts needed in a case of an emergency, such as unexpected medical bills, urgent family financial need or any other unexpected expenses that might occur during the month. As such expenses are usually not budgeted for, you may find yourself without the necessary funds and in a position where you cannot wait until your next payday, as these funds need to be paid immediately. This is when Bridge Finance can help you with payday loans that you can borrow and repay when you receive your next salary.
